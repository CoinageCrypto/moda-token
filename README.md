MODA DAO Token Contract ($MODA)

# Problem Statement
The music industry is designed to fail. The middlemen who soak up value in the ecosystem have no interest in driving change because these failures line their pockets. Even the most innovative music tech companies start-up trying to serve the needs of the artists end up selling out to big labels or big tech companies.

# Token Solution
A tokenised, music-centered creative technology company and innovation fund, would be able to provide all of the benefits of a traditional music or big tech company, without having to sacrifice its integrity for the benefit of traditional shareholders.

We propose the MODA membership token as a mechanism to unite members at all levels of the foundation from the board to the community. We proposed a ‘path to decentralization’ approach that matures alongside technological and regulatory maturation.

# ERC-20 $MODA Token
The $MODA ERC-20 token is designed as a DAO membership token, bringing with it the ability to vote on proposals and earn rewards in exchange for participation within the DAO. MODA tokens will be the value capture and delivery mechanism for an otherwise non-profit organisation meaning that all value created by the DAO is driving back into the ecosystem, not out to exrernal shareholders. Additional detail of the token will be communicated via https://modadao.io.

### Registering a contract on Etherscan

The source code will need to be flattened to register a contract on Etherscan.

## Verify
To verify the contract code:

```bash
cd /path/to/project/files/
yarn run verify Token Grants --network kovan
```
