# modadao-token
ModaDAO Token Contract

# Problem Statement
The music industry is designed to fail. The middlemen who soak up value in the ecosystem have no interest in driving change because these failures line their pockets. Even the most innovative music tech companies start-up trying to serve the needs of the artists end up selling out to big labels or big tech companies.

# Token Solution
A tokenised, music-centered creative technology company and innovation fund, would be able to provide all of the benefits of a traditional music or big tech company, without having to sacrifice its integrity for the benefit of traditional shareholders.

We propose the MODA membership token as a mechanism to unite members at all levels of the foundation from the board to the community. We proposed a ‘path to decentralization’ approach that matures alongside technological and regulatory maturation.

`nvm use 14.15.4`

## Kovan

`npx hardhat node -m carpet dynamic deal utility emerge guide matter child rapid thunder option`

### Compile

`npx hardhat compile`

### Registering a contract on Etherscan
